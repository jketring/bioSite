     <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I was born in Rogers Arkansas to her parent Bill and Tammy Tuggle. As I grew up I played soccer and enjoyed spending time at the roller rink.
                    During this time, I was a floor guard at the roller rink as well as started a full-time job at Wendy’s fast food restaurant that her my managed. 
                    I excelled in English classes during High School but I was definitely not one for Math and Science. 
                    At 18, I began beauty school in hopes of going into the Navy as a sailor, following in my father’s footsteps. 
                    Shortly after that I had my first child, Reilly Tuggle, who is now 14. His name comes from my obsession with Ireland, at the time. 
                    Rhett was born about a year later and his name comes from my favorite book, Gone with the Wind. 
                    Currently, I am the mother of five children each with an R in each of their first name. The other three are named Robby, Reed and Rheya. 
                    Yes, that is 4 boys and 1 girl. I enjoy having a good time with the kids but also enjoys going out to concerts, amusement parks, 
                    hikes, traveling and on float trips. Even with all of that I hold down a full-time job, currently with Genpact and formerly with Walmart doing financial reporting.
                    I started there in 2011 and recently transitioned to Genpact in a sell off of the Walmart financial services group. I lead our youth group at church, 
                    sing and play the bass guitar. My life is super busy but I feel like I do a great job of holding down our fort.

                    <h2>Church Leader</h2>
                    <p>I love serving in our small church, Crossroads Baptist Church of Pea Ridge, 
                        where I lead the youth group, play the bass and sing in the band.</p>

    <h2>Traveller</h2>
        <P>Although I don’t get to travel as much as I’d like to, my list of dream places is very long. 
            My dream trip is to go and spend some time in Ireland. Along with this, I want to go do an 
            eco-vacation in Costa Rica which consists of zip-lines through the jungle, class 5 rapid whitewater 
            trips and staying in all inclusive resorts in the jungle. I’m a beach girl though, so I love going and 
            experiencing many different beaches. I’ve been to New York, Cozumel, Cancun, Haiti, Florida (many times), Galveston,
             and Half Moon Bay in California (where they surf Mavricks). My dad lives in Florida so our family goes 
             down to see him and stay on the beach in Fort Myers each year. If I could, I would quit my job and live on the beach full-time.</P>

        <h2>Mom</h2>
        <p>I’m a mom of 5 kids and spend tons of time driving them to soccer,
             baseball and football games. Getting them out of the house is best.</p>

            <h2>Reader</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, I don’t get to read as much as I want to these days but 
                I’m a fast reader and if I can get a couple hours of free time at home 
                with a good book I can read the entire thing. Rainy days are good for 
                this activity in my life. My favorites are fantasy books with Angels, 
                Demons, Vampires and Witches but I still have a respect for the classics. 
                Again my favorite book is Gone With The Wind!</p>
